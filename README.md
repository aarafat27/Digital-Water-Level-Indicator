## ‚öóÔ∏è Digital-Water-Level-Indicator
Development of a Low-Cost Digital Water Level  Display using Encoders-BCD to 7Segment-Hex  Inverter.
***
The objective of this report was to develop a method to measure the liquid volume level of any container. The developed approach offers a liquid 
volume level counter which was made using priority encoder and BCD Decoder. The system is designed to replace traditional water level indicators, which can be 
inaccurate and unreliable. The developed digital water level display is capable of measuring water levels in real-time and displaying the readings on a 7-segment 
display. The findings indicated that the prosed method is very well capable enough to address and solve the liquid volume level problems. The liquid level indicator can contribute to serve the people and can help save a lot of water that overflows on a daily basics and that water can be used in case of emergencies. The liquid volume level counter does have many advantages but it does also have many drawbacks. The system is accurate, reliable, and easy to use, making it an ideal solution for 
a wide range of liquid level monitoring applications. Future research can be done in this water level counter to reduce all these sort drawbacks.
